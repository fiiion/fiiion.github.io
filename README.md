# Welcome!

My name is Fiona Edwardson, I am a recent graduate of the University of Chicago, with a BS in Geophysical sciences.

My coding background includes a year of working with GIS technologies, including visualizations in QGIS and data wrangling in R. I also have two years of experience coding in Python, primarily working on computational and statistical methods relevant to astrophysical and geophysical sciences.
